    "The selected study region is located in France and is defined by coordinates ranging from 43.5°N to 47.5°N latitude and 0°E to 6°E longitude. This region encompasses several major cities, including Angers, Dijon, Pau, and Marseille, which are situated near the vertices of the rectangle that defines this chosen area. It spans multiple administrative regions, namely Nouvelle-Aquitaine, Occitanie, Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur, Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, Bourgogne-Franche-Comté, and Centre-Val de Loire.\n",

    "Regarding agriculture, the region boasts a diverse array of practices that mirror its geographical diversity. These practices encompass field cropping, cattle farming, mixed farming, vineyards, sheep and goat husbandry, as well as orchards.\n"
